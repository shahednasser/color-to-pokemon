# Color To Pokemon

Check it out [here](http://color-to-pokemon.surge.sh/)

Find a Pokemon based on a random generated color. This uses the [Hexbot API](https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/hexbot) to generate the random color,
[Nearest Color](https://github.com/dtao/nearest-color) to find the basic nearest color, and [PokeAPI js wrapper](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper)
to fetch a Pokemon based on that color.
